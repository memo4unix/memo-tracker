# Welcome to memo's issue tracker!

You can use it to request features and file bugs, but also for general discussion (if you like). [Click here](https://github.com/memo4unix/memo-tracker/issues) (or on the "Issues" link nearly at the top) to see all issues.

Issues are prioritised by the number of votes they receive. You can vote using [GitHub's Reactions feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

This page is still in an early stage. Feedback is highly appreciated! If you have ideas or suggestions for improvements, please [open an issue](https://github.com/memo4unix/memo-tracker/issues/new).
